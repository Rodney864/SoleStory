**Project Title: History of Jordans Website**

**Description:**
This project was completed during the Spring semester and showcases the rich history of Jordans, paying homage to the iconic line of athletic shoes. The website consists of a Home page and three other pages, each offering unique insights into the evolution and significance of Jordan sneakers.

**Features:**
1. **Owl Carousel:** The website incorporates an engaging Owl Carousel, allowing visitors to view captivating images and highlights of different Jordan shoe models in a visually appealing and interactive manner.

2. **Tooltip Widgets:** To enhance user experience and provide additional information, two tooltip widgets have been seamlessly integrated throughout the site. These widgets provide context and details when users hover their cursor over specific elements, making the journey through the history of Jordans more informative and enjoyable.

3. **Verification Form:** A verification form has been implemented, ensuring that genuine enthusiasts can participate in exclusive features or offers. This form adds a layer of interactivity and helps connect with the target audience effectively.

**Technologies Used:**
The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a responsive and visually pleasing design for users across different devices. The Owl Carousel plugin has been utilized to create the dynamic carousel feature. For tooltip functionality, jQuery UI library is employed. The verification form leverages JavaScript for validation and secure data submission.

**Contributions:**
I, Rodney Smith, was the sole contributor to this project. I played a crucial role in designing, developing, and testing all the components to ensure a seamless and comprehensive user experience.
